You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  
* What new skills have you learned?

   - Researching on new topics
   -  The very foundation how to built a blog.

* What has been easy?
 
   - The way of teaching and simple english used made to understand the topics very easy.

* What has been difficult?
  
   - Since this is initial stage of learning, I feel everthing is ok. Nothing felt difficult.

* How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?


 There were few constrains in obtaing the final output for this project. I tried several times and went back through the classes once more. Finally I felt that I have gained some knowledge from all the work that is done.
